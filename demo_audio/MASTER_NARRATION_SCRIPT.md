# 🎬 Master Narration Script for Demo Recording

**Instructions**: Play each audio file at the specified timing during screen recording

## Segment 1: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_01.aiff`

**Script**:
> "Welcome to our Google Hackathon submission - an AI Agent Orchestration System that analyzes REAL companies with LIVE data. Unlike demos with fake data, we're about to analyze actual businesses like NVIDIA, AMD, and Tesla using real financial data, social sentiment, and competitive intelligence."

---

## Segment 2: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_02.aiff`

**Script**:
> "Our system addresses all four Google Hackathon judging criteria. Technical Excellence through live API integration and production-ready architecture. Solution Architecture with 8 orchestrated AI agents sharing intelligence. Innovative Gemini Integration with sophisticated business analysis. And Societal Impact by democratizing enterprise-grade business intelligence for any organization."

---

## Segment 3: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_03.aiff`

**Script**:
> "First, Technical Excellence - our system integrates live APIs with production-grade reliability. I'm entering NVIDIA and AI/Semiconductor industry. Watch as our Research Assistant Agent gathers REAL financial data from Yahoo Finance, news sentiment from Google News, and competitive intelligence from Wikipedia. Current stock price $173.50, market cap $4.2 trillion, competitors AMD and Intel - these are live numbers, not demo data. This demonstrates robust API integration with error handling and graceful degradation."

---

## Segment 4: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_04.aiff`

**Script**:
> "Next, Solution Architecture - our modular agent design enables true orchestration. The Research Agent automatically shared NVIDIA's business context with all other agents. Watch as I select Comprehensive strategy - notice the Company Context field is empty because context flows automatically. The Strategy Agent performs SWOT-TOWS analysis using NVIDIA's actual $4.2T market cap versus AMD's $240B. This demonstrates clean architecture with shared intelligence, not isolated AI tools requiring manual data entry."

## Segment 5: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_05.aiff`

**Script**:
> "Third, Innovative Gemini Integration - each agent uses sophisticated AI prompts tailored for business intelligence. The Social Media Agent analyzes NVIDIA's competitive position using advanced Gemini reasoning. The Customer Support Agent combines NVIDIA intelligence with customer service AI. I'm entering a customer inquiry mentioning Sarah Johnson and NVIDIA interest. Watch how Gemini generates professional responses incorporating live business context and customer memory."

---

## Segment 6: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_06.aiff`

**Script**:
> "Our system demonstrates production-ready architecture. It works perfectly with just the Gemini API key, but scales with additional APIs for enhanced functionality. We have graceful degradation - Twitter API adds real social monitoring, News API provides comprehensive sentiment analysis. The system is containerized and deployment-ready, with proper environment variable management and security best practices."

---

## Segment 7: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_07.aiff`

**Script**:
> "Finally, Societal Impact and Novelty - this system democratizes enterprise-grade business intelligence. I'm testing AMD to show consistency - notice different market cap $240B versus NVIDIA's $4.2T, but same analytical rigor. Now testing persistent memory - Sarah's follow-up inquiry. The system remembers her name and previous NVIDIA conversation even across sessions. This replaces expensive CRM, BI, and analytics tools with a single intelligent platform accessible to any organization."

---

## Segment 8: 0:00 - 0:15

**Audio File**: `narration_segment_08.aiff`

**Script**:
> "AI agent orchestration with real business intelligence. Live data, persistent memory, strategic analysis. Thank you for considering our Google Hackathon submission."
